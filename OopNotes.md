What are the four fundamental concepts of OOP? Explain each in your own terms.

a. ENCAPSULATION : combine all relevent data and methods into a single unit called objects. This ensure that any data related to an object can only be accessed or modify using predefined methods, which helps enhanced security and hide sensitive data.

b. INHERITANCE : a mechanisum that allows one class to inherit properties and behaviour from another class. The subclass that inherits from the parent class can either use the methods of the parent class, or it can also override its methods. This in turn promote reusable codes and established coupling of relations between different objects.

c. POLYMORPHISUM : A mechanisum that allows different classes to be treated as common classes i.e. interface, which enable pre-defined methods to be implemented across different classes. This promotes code flexibility and loose coupling between different objects.

d. ABSTRACTION: A process of simplying complex code by showing only the relevent features or methods of classes while hiding the irrelevent. Abstraction is achieved by abstract classes, interfaces as well as access modifiers. This allows developers to focus on only the functional methods, and abstracting the rest of the irrelvent codes.
