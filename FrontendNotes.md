React:

What is JSX and what are props?
- JSX is an extension syntax used in React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. JSX allows developers to write HTML-like syntax directly in JavaScript code, making it easier to create and manipulate the structure and appearance of UI components.
- JSX combines the power of JavaScript and HTML-like syntax, allowing developers to define the structure and behavior of React components in a declarative and intuitive way. It provides a convenient and readable way to describe how UI elements should be rendered based on the component's state and props.
- Props, short for "properties," are used in React to pass data from a parent component to its child components. They are similar to HTML attributes and provide a way to customize and configure components with different values.


What are hooks? Give some commonly used hooks.
- In React, hooks are functions that allow functional components to access and utilize React features, such as state management, lifecycle methods, and context, without the need for class components. Hooks were introduced in React version 16.8 and provide a more concise and flexible way to write reusable and stateful logic in functional components.
- useEffect, useState, useContext, useReducer, useMemo
