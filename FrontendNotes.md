React:

What is JSX and what are props?
- JSX is an extension syntax used in React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. JSX allows developers to write HTML-like syntax directly in JavaScript code, making it easier to create and manipulate the structure and appearance of UI components.
- JSX combines the power of JavaScript and HTML-like syntax, allowing developers to define the structure and behavior of React components in a declarative and intuitive way. It provides a convenient and readable way to describe how UI elements should be rendered based on the component's state and props.
- Props, short for "properties," are used in React to pass data from a parent component to its child components. They are similar to HTML attributes and provide a way to customize and configure components with different values.
