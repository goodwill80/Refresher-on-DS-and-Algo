What is the difference between Agile and Waterfall methodologies?

- AGILE : Project management by breaking it up into phrases. Each phase or stage involves close and continuous collaboration between stakeholders.

- WATERFALL : A clearly defined sequence of execution with project phases that do not advance until a phase receives final approval. Once a phase is completed, it can be difficult and costly to revisit a previous stage. (1. Requirement Gathering, 2. Design, 3. Implementation, 4. Test and Verifications, Deployment & Maintainance)

a. Waterfall is sequential and linear (one needs to be completed 1st b4 moving to another), while Agile is flexible and adapt to changing requirements during development process

b. Waterfall is more rigid and less flexible and can be time consuming and costly.

c. Waterfall involves less customer involvement and only covers initial requirement gathering and reviewing the final product. While agile emphasize on close collaboration with the customer at every phase, and customer is involves in prioritising feedback and reviews.

d. Waterfall emphsize more on documentation, while agile emphasize more on working software.

What is XSS and how can it be prevented?

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.
